# Initialize Repo

**Initialize Repo** is a tool that automatically sets up the basic structure and configuration required when starting a new project. It specifically focuses on establishing an environment where developers and AI can communicate efficiently by generating metadata files such as `AGENTS.md` for collaboration with AI agents.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Support for AGENTS.md 1.1 Standard:
    - Hierarchical Context: Automatically designs inheritance and precedence structures for instructions based on directory levels.
    - Clear Jurisdiction: Defines the scope of AI influence based on file location to prevent context conflicts.
- Separation of Behavior and Capabilities:
    - AGENTS.md: Defines the AI agent's behavior, rules, and workflows.
    - SKILL.md: Defines tools (capabilities) and skills usable by the agent (Compatible with Claude Skills).
- Project Scaffolding: Generates optimized directory structures for different project types such as Web, CLI, and Library.
- Development Environment Automation: One-click setup for essential configurations like Git initialization (.gitignore) and Linter/Formatter (ESLint, Prettier).

## 📄 What is AGENTS.md?

`AGENTS.md` is a document designed to clearly convey the project's context, roles, coding conventions, and architectural principles to AI agents (coding assistants) participating in the project. The `AGENTS.md` generated by this tool helps AI improve response quality and maintain project consistency.
